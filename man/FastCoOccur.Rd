\title{a very efficient c++ implementation of the pair-wise Spearman rank co-occurrence.}
\usage{
FastCoOccur(phyloseq_obj, treatment, p = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyloseq_obj}{A \linkS4class{phyloseq-class} object created with the \link[=phyloseq]{phyloseq} package.}

\item{treatment}{the column name or number of the treatment to be comapred.}

\item{p}{the p-value cutoff. all returned co-occurrences must have a p-value less than or equal to p.}
}
\description{
This function is a rewrite of the pair-wise Spearman rank co-occurence routine written by Jin Choi. I adapted the routine to integrate with the Rcpp API.

\examples{
data(mock_phyloseq)
FastCoOccur(mock_phyloseq, "day", 0.05)
