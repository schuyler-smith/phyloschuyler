<a href="https://github.com/schuyler-smith/phylosmith" targe="_blank" >phylosmith</a> is a conglomeration of functions written to process and analyze `phyloseq-class` objects. <a href="https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/" targe="_blank" >Phyloseq</a> objects are a great data-standard for microbiome, gene-expression, and many other data types.

A lot of these functions are just to make "data-wrangling" easier for the user. Others will implement complex routines in a, hopefully, efficient and concise manner. I have also made functions to make figures for quick examination of data, but they may or may not be suitable for publication as some may require parameter optimization.

### [Calculations][calc]
Call | Description
-------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------
[bootstrap_rho](calculations#bootstrap_rho) | runs permutations of the otu_table to calculate a significant $\rho$ value
[co_occurrence](calculations#co_occurrence) | calculate co-occurrence between taxa
[quantile_bootstrapped_rhos](calculations#quantile_bootstrapped_rhos) | calculate quantiles for the bootstrapped rho values from the Spearman-rank co-occurrence
[histogram_bootstrapped_rhos](calculations#histogram_bootstrapped_rhos) | Create a ggplot object of the distribution of rho values.

### Datasets
Originally I had created 2 mock phyloseq objects (`mock_phyloseq` and `mock_phyloseq2`) that had no real-world data but served to show simple examples of how the functions worked. 

Then I decided that I should include a real example of microbiome data (`soil_column`) becasue it's always nice to see real examples. `soil_column` is a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.03197/full" target="_blank" >published dataset</a>  from my lab-group. The data is from an experiment where they looked at the microbial composition of farmland soil before and after manure application, over time, using 16S-sequencing.
